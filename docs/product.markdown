Product Documentation
=====================

This part of documentation covers product definition, this should can explain various features of Arlin. As we're making an actual app that potentially could be used and very useful by a lot of people, we're putting this beyond just a project; a product. This relates to <https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi/issues/14>.

As mentioned in the beginning, Arlin (Arah lalu lintas) is a community-driven transportation helper for anyone in the city/town. Arlin is designed as a question-answer forum that is simple and clear. Since there's a similar app or platform our there, like Haaash and Stack Overflow, we should learn from them first.
