Technical Documentation
=======================

> How to develop, build, test, and use it? Refer to each particular development README in each application folder/repo. Those are in [`backend`](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi-backend), [`frontend`](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi-frontend), and [`test`](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi-test) repo.

We've been using Linux Ubuntu, Windows, POSIX shell, text editors, Git, GitHub, Waffle, ZenHub, SSH, and other various tools to develop our project from the project management through documentation.

We're planning to use these kinds of technologies to actually develop, build, test, and monitor our software application:

+ Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, SemanticUI or Bootstrap or Material Design Lite, Vue.js
+ Backend: REST API, Node.js (Meteor/Feathers)
+ Database and Search: MongoDB, NeDB
+ Build and Package Management System: npm, webpack
+ Server: Linux Ubuntu, Digital Ocean VPS, Docker
+ Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD): Codeship or Snap CI
+ Tracking, monitoring, and analytics: Google Analytics, Monitority, New Relic

Current Technology Infrastucture
--------------------------------

Main Stacks:

+ Application (Node.js, Feathers, Vue.js)
+ Database (NeDB)
+ Delivery (pm2, Docker)
+ Operating System (Linux Ubuntu)
+ Hardware (Digital Ocean VPS, CI/CD SaaS)
+ Network (Uniregistry, CloudFlare, IP, DNS)
