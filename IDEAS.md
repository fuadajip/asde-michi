### Rating university/campus quality

+ App Name:
  + Rate My Campus, Campus Finder, or Kampusaya
+ Target User:
  + User Persona/Definition: University/campus students, in any year. But prospective students are also possible.
  + Problem Definition: Prospective students are often confused which university/campus they should to apply for. So they should easily access information about campus reality, according to their preferred field. In the other hand, current students want to share and know more about the reality of their campus. Things like happiness, reputation, discoverability, opportunity, affordability/price, culinary/food, hobbies/clubs; are just some of the important factors to rate.
  + Side Note: Not to be compared with Facebook or Twitter, because they're a very generic social platform.
+ Main Functionality:
  + Sharing student's experience and opinions about their university life based on various factors.
+ Similars/Competitors:
  + Rate My Professors, Rate My Teachers, MyEdu, Professor Performance
+ Completion Time Estimation (ETA):
  + About 30 days or 4 weeks.
