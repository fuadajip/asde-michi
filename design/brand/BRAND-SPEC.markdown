Branding Design Specification
============================
## Brand Purpose 

**What does our brand stand for?**

Arlin is a platform where user can aquire informations regarding public transportation. Arlin helps people of all kinds, and with our principal "from us, by us, for you", we feel the needs of everyone to get involved and participate by asking and also helping people in need.

**What is the Arlin's mission?**

We believe that people should always prepare of what's coming. And that includes your transporation plan. Jakarta's public transportation is more or less a messy situation, and we can help you prepare better by having you asking the right question in the platform.

**How did the name come about? Does the name has any special meaning or significance?**

Arlin is a short for "ARah lalu LINtas, which roughly translate as "traffic way". Arlin also stands for a common Indonesian name which serves the purpose of making the brand easy in the ears and tongues of the locals. 

**What is unique about your Arlin? Why should people choose your Arlin?**

Arlin's services might reminds you of one feature of Google Maps that is able to direct you to the destination by public transportation. While it is seemingly more convenient and faster way to get the direction, the algorithm sometimes feels off and unreliable. So we decide to take the advantages of the more reliable, trustable sources, which in the experienced, local, real human who know their way of Jakarta better than the most advanced AI technology.

**The Psychology of Color** <br>
Based on ["Design for Software"](https://books.google.co.id/books?isbn=1119943701) by Erik Klimczak)
The colors that we used can be put as 3 dominant colors which are: gray, blue, and green.

Gray is a neutral color and is grouped into the cool color family . Gray is often considered to be dreary or depressing, but itâ€™s also associated with endurance, classic, refined, conservative, and authoritative . Lighter grays are very commonly used for backgrounds as a way to offset the starkness of white. The same is true for dark grays when using them as an alternative forpure black 

Blue is synonymous with sadness, but it can also represent stability and trust . Blue is often seen in medical and financial institutions because it has a natural ability to invoke a sense of faith, power, and calmness . Light blues can give a clean and crisp feel.

Green is associated with life, growth, healing, money, safety, and relaxation. Green can also be used to represent envy and jealously . Muted variations of the hue can have a calming and balancing effect. Green is appropriate for designs related to renewal, wealth, and environment . Lighter shades of green are very energizing and can invoke a sense of movement.
