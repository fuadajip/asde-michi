### [#1](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi/issues/1): Generate and improve our ideas
Each team member had to generate and explain their idea. All ideas has been written to [IDEAS](docs/IDEAS.markdown) file. Some ideas would be eliminated until we got one good and proper idea.

### [#2](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi/issues/2): Choose a project management and software development methods
We decided our project management and software development methods. We considered Minimal Agile Kanban with GitHub and Waffle as our suitable project management.

### [#3](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi/issues/3): Include slide inside main repo
Made it easy to make the slide for Michi Team by separating the repo. The slide assets will be included within `slide` directory.

### [#13](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi/issues/13): Explain our project management and software development methods
Clearly explained our project management and software development methodologies, based on what we had chosen before. The Project Management Documentation is clearly written and include the essentials.

### [#16](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi/issues/16): Specify team member roles
Each team members should be specified by their main tasks/works. We could  see explicitly who and what were the team member roles. Also understood about our management-less approach.

### [#21](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi/issues/21): Tidy up various submodules
Tidy up various submodules that include the slide, app, and the web. Everyone had to understand and used submodules to pull various resources outside this repo.

### [#32](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi/issues/32): Determine templates for master test plan
We decided to choose our master test plan template. We adapted [Master Test Plan (v061111) by Northwestern University Information Technology (in DOCX format)](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/bin/docs/project-framework/Master_Test_Plan_v061111.docx) as our master test plan based on our project management.
