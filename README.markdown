# Arlin by Michi

Arlin (Arah lalu lintas) is a community-driven transportation helper for anyone in the city. The contents will be user generated as the visitors/users discuss something. We provide a platform where user can ask a specific transporation-related question with rating system for each answers. It's like a Stack Exchange equivalent for asking road direction. We expect to complete v1 of the MVP in 4-5 weeks.

The main users mostly are citizens who commute with public/private transporation daily. We need this app because majority of traffic and roads condition in some cities can sometime be an overwhelming experience. Google Maps can sure be a good companion yet in contrary, the chaotic transportation layout is destroying the premises, rendering Google Maps useless, if not efficient. While there are lots of experienced people ready to help at all times, there is virtually not a single medium to connect both parties.

### Materials

+ Introduction and Ideation
+ Project Management
+ Software Design
+ Design Analysis
+ Evaluation
+ Software Quality
+ System Testing and Implementation
+ Project Presentation

### Development Process

+ Ideation
  + Choose an idea then present it.
  + Constantly improve or iterate on the idea.
  + The idea is a usable software application.
  + Implement the idea using any kind of methods.
+ Build
  + Document the software design and engineering theory sufficiently.
  + Build the software using any kind of libraries or frameworks.
+ Presentation
  + Present the result to the class.
  + The winner will be chosen.

[TIPS] Modern software development phase:
  + Initial idea, design sketches and quick prototypes
  + Write some code, probably with free tools
  + Find a server for hosting
  + Do some testing
  + Pick a price and build a little marketing around it
  + Ship your product with a few clicks
  + Iterate and ship it again
