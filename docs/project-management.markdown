Project Management Documentation
================================

Method
------

Here we have picked the most appropriate project management method and style depending on our team member capabilities.

For Michi team, we're using Minimal Agile Kanban with GitHub and Waffle.

### Agile

**Agile Principles** or Agile Software Development is a set of principles for software development in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

This principles value:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

### Kanban

**Kanban Methodologies** is a new technique for managing a software development process in a highly efficient way. It is another framework used to implement agile. Kanban underpins Toyota's "just-in-time" (JIT) production system. Although producing a software is a creative activity and therefore, different to mass-producing cars, the underlying mechanism for managing the production line can still be applied.

### Minimal

**Minimal Project Management** consists of only a few steps (and one change process):

- Assignment and prioritization of work.
- A Statement of Work (SOW) to define the task or project.
- A single weekly review of progress.
- A Management of Change process.

> That’s all there is to it. The team gets to manage their own time. They know the priority and impact of the work, the dependencies, the business needs and their key deliverables as its discussed in the meeting. They know the standards expected of their work, the tests to run to be sure their deliverables are correct and the pressure we are all under.

### GitHub Flow

**GitHub Flow** is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly.

### Waffle Board

Currently beside within GitHub; our project management, progress documentation, and kanban board are also available on Waffle.io (https://waffle.io/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi). It automatically put all of the GitHub issues –including all of the Statement of Work (SOW) in our case– in the appropriate columns.
