### Development Process

+ Ideation
  + Choose an idea then present it.
  + Constantly improve or iterate on the idea.
  + The idea is a usable software application.
  + Implement the idea using any kind of methods.
+ Build
  + Document the software design and engineering theory sufficiently.
  + Build the software using any kind of libraries or frameworks.

[TIPS] Modern software development phase:  
  + Initial idea, design sketches and quick prototypes
  + Write some code, probably with free tools
  + Find a server for hosting
  + Do some testing
  + Pick a price and build a little marketing around it
  + Ship your product with a few clicks
  + Iterate and ship it again
