### Community-driven transportation helper

+ App Name:
  + Whereto/NaikApa/Arahi
+ Target User:
  + User Persona/Definition: Jakartans who commute with public transporation daily.
  + Problem Definition: A new, prospective job in Jakarta is sure a dream for everybody.

While there are lots of experienced people ready to help at all times, there is virtually not a single medium to connect both parties. 
  + Side Note: basically a Stack Exchange equivalent for asking direction.
+ Main Functionality:
  + a platform where user can ask a specific transporation-related question with rating system for each answers.
+ Similars/Competitors:
  + none that I know of.
+ Completion Time Estimation (ETA):
  + 4-5 weeks.
